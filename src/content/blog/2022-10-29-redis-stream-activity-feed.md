I recently built a demo project for the purpose of testing the usage of [Redis](https://redis.io/?ref=blog.christophervachon.com) as an activity feed of recent changes to a system. As the project this proof of concept already uses [Redis](https://redis.io/?ref=blog.christophervachon.com) in multiple capacities, we wanted to try to utilize it in this capacity to maintain the current dependency stack.

## Redis Stream

I chose to use [Redis Streams](https://redis.io/docs/data-types/streams/?ref=blog.christophervachon.com) for multiple reasons:

1.  I can set a Maximum Length of the Stream.
2.  I select from the last ID natively with the Stream.
3.  A Redis Stream is Optimized for this exact use case.

## The Project Overview

The project itself is in [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/?ref=blog.christophervachon.com) utilizing a single Â [API endpoint](https://github.com/CodeVachon/feed-testing/blob/main/src/pages/api/feed.ts?ref=blog.christophervachon.com) for the Redis Connection. I set up a `POST` action to add a new record to the Stream and a `GET` method to retrieve the latest items of the feed. A simple interface was developed to interact with the feed through the `API` endpoint.
