While looking to migrate and update my online presence, I decided that I wanted to incorporate one of those fancy interactive background images into my content. This lead me into the world of 2D Canvas.

I found this series of YouTube videos that gives a decent primer. It does progress from the stand point that the viewer has bare minimum to no development knowledge. I was able to jump about fairly easily without missing a whole lot. It did get me started with a basic understanding of Canvas Animations.

From these, I was able to quickly build this neat little canvas application that reacts to your mouse.

I thought it was pretty cool, and a great deal easier that I had anticipated. I am sure that this is going to be just the start of a deep dive into HTML Canvas.
