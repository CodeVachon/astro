While updating my online presence, I needed to create multiple media queries for the style sheets. This gets to be very tedious to do of course, even in a pre-compiler like [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/?ref=blog.christophervachon.com).

Doing a little digging around, I found that SCSS has a Map function, which got me thinking about passing a label into a mixin to create my media queries. This lead me into several new areas in SCSS I had yet to dive into.

This was the Result of that.
