Recently, CSS Grid has landed for all modern browsers (as per [CanIUse:Feature CSS Grid](http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-grid)). This isn't anything thats come out of the blue, but it is impressive that it has landing in most browsers in a similar timeframe.

Recently, [Rachel Andrew](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/) gave a great talk on the topic which was uploaded to [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjHOLtouElA&ref=blog.christophervachon.com). This was a great introduction to the subject for me, and also provides a brief comparison between CSS Grid and CSS FlexBox.

From this presentation, and this excellently designed tutorial game on using CSS Grid ([Grid Garden](http://cssgridgarden.com/)), I have made my own little CodePen (below) trying out CSS Grid myself.

If you haven't started playing with CSS Grid yet, start now! This is a complete game changer in the world of Web Design and Development.
