Today I received a request to production to resolve a but where a form would break if an invalid country code was passed in as part of an address.

The solution that was proposed was to modify the validation scripts to accept the improper values as valid in order to load the form. However, this validation code is used globally and would then allow all other addresses validations to accept those values system wide. This proposed solution was thus rejected and changed to resolve the issue with the broken form itself.

This lead to the following which I thought needed to be shared.
