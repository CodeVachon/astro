# Hi, I'm Christopher

I am a Canadian Web Application Developer located on Southern Georgian Bay, a husband and father, and Sailor in the summer season and Skiier in the winter season.

For the last twenty years, I have built a career of developing a wide range of web applications from a simple todo app, to complex kubernetes applications running multiple processes. I was there on the web before css 3 was announced and before jQuery was a widely used framework. In fact, my first programs were written in a DOS application called QBasic which shipped with early windows machines. Now I lead a team of very talented developers to build a SAAS platform for the sub trade construction industry.

From time to time, I like to post things I have found or learned through my adventures, you can check [my blog](/blog) for a list of those.
