Beer is one of the oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic drinks in the world. It is typically made from water, malted barley, hops, and yeast. Beer is brewed by fermentation of the sugars derived from starch-based materialâ€”the most common being malted barley. Though beer is the most popular alcoholic drink in the world, it is the third most popular drink overall, after water and tea.
